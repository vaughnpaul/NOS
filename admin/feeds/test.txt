http://192.168.1.35/loaded615test/product_info.php?products_id=23 The Wheel Of Time The world in which The Wheel of Time takes place is lifted directly out of Jordan&#39s pages; it&#39s huge and consists of many different environments. How you navigate the world will depend largely on which game - single player or multipayer - you&#39re playing. The single player experience, with a few exceptions, will see Elayna traversing the world mainly by foot (with a couple notable exceptions). In the multiplayer experience, your character will have more access to travel via Ter&#39angreal, Portal Stones, and the Ways. However you move around, though, you&#39ll quickly discover that means of locomotion can easily become the least of the your worries...  During your travels, you quickly discover that four locations are crucial to your success in the game. Not surprisingly, these locations are the homes of The Wheel of Time&#39s main characters. Some of these places are ripped directly from the pages of Jordan&#39s books, made flesh with Legend&#39s unparalleled pixel-pushing ways. Other places are specific to the game, conceived and executed with the intent of expanding this game world even further. Either way, they provide a backdrop for some of the most intense first person action and strategy you&#39ll have this year.  99.99 http://192.168.1.35/loaded615test/images/gt_interactive/wheel_of_time.gif  Software > Strategy  23
